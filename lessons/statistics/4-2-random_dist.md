[Think Stats Chapter 4 Exercise 2](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2005.html#toc41) (a random distribution)

#Exercise 4.2 The numbers generated by random.random are supposed to be uniform between 0 and 1; 

#that is, every value in the range should have the same probability.

#Generate 1000 numbers from random.random and plot their PMF and CDF. Is the distribution uniform?

sampl = np.random.random(1000)

sampl_pmf=thinkstats2.Pmf(sampl)
thinkplot.Pmf(sampl_pmf) 
thinkplot.Show(xlabel='random numbers', ylabel='PMF')

sampl_cdf = thinkstats2.Cdf(sampl)

thinkplot.PrePlot(2)
thinkplot.Cdf(sampl_cdf) 
thinkplot.Show(xlabel='random numbers', ylabel='CDF')

# Yes, pmf shows uniform distribution (constant line), and CDF shows 45 degree linear line, confirming the uniform distribution
